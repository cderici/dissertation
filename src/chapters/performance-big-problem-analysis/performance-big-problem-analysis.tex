\chapter{Performance Analysis of Self-Hosting with Meta-tracing}

	\begin{chapterpoint}
		Pycket did not suffer too much general performance hit by hosting Racket.

		Branchy code makes tracing worse.

		Self-hosting on Pycket brings some memory issues.
	\end{chapterpoint}

	\section{General Performance Impact of Self-Hosting}

		\begin{mainpoint}
			There's no reason Pycket with full Racket should be faster than the original Pycket.

			Warmup is worse.
		\end{mainpoint}

		\begin{todo}[Import]
				Read section 3.2 "Performance" in the Quals written document.
		\end{todo}

		\subsection{Cross Benchmarks}

			\begin{mainpoint}
				Argue using CrossBenchmarks that it's not too much worse.
			\end{mainpoint}

	\section{Runtime Performance of Tracing Data-Dependent Branchy Code}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			Branchy code makes tracing worse.
		\end{mainpoint}

		\subsection{Regexp experiments}
		\subsection{Branchy experiments}

	\section{Memory Issues with Self-Hosting}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			Long continuation chains cause problems.

			Big and old heap objects cause GC pressure.
		\end{mainpoint}

		valgrind analyses

		\begin{todo}[Import]
			Section 3.4.1 Garbage Collection (GC) Pressure of the proposal document is relevant for this section.
