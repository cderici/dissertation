\begin{mainpoint}
Making programming languages more portable is good.

It requires improving communication between the compiler and runtime.
\end{mainpoint}

\section{Linklets as Compilation Units}

\begin{mainpoint}
Linklets are a good communication tool/mechanism between the compiler and runtime.
\end{mainpoint}

\subsection{Operational Semantics of Linklets}

\begin{mainpoint}
Linklets have well-defined operational semantics.
\end{mainpoint}

\subsection{Executable Redex Model for Linklets}

\begin{mainpoint}
Operational semantics of linklets do work.
