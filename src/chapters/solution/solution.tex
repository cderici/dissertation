\chapter{Approaches to Improve Self-hosting Performance}

	\label{chapter:solution}

	\begin{chaptersynopsis}
		We have identified solution approaches that are worthy of further investigation for improving self-hosting performance.

		You either try to avoid branch-heavy code, or you try to get better at meta-tracing branch-heavy code.
	\end{chaptersynopsis}

	\section{Guiding Tracer Away from Branch-Heavy Computation}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			Trying to detect branch-heavy computations and help the tracer forgo them seems like a promising idea.

		\end{mainpoint}
		\subsection{Hot Branch Detection - Meta-hints}


	\section{Mitigating Memory Pressure in Branch-Heavy Computation}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			The nature of this type of computation makes it a fundamental problem for meta-tracing (aforementioned in earlier chapters). There's not much to do to get better at this.

			A different model of computation (e.g., a stackful model alongside CEK) could mitigate memory issues.
		\end{mainpoint}

		\subsection{Stackful Model alongside CEK}
		- Redex model investigating stack/heap balance

		\begin{todo}[Import]
			Section 3.4.1 Garbage Collection (GC) Pressure of the proposal document is relevant for this section.
