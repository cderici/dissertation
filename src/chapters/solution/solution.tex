\chapter{Approaches to Improve Self-hosting Performance}
	\begin{chapterpoint}
		We have identified solution approaches that are worthy of further investigation.

		You either try to avoid branch-heavy code, or you try to get better at meta-tracing branch-heavy code.
	\end{chapterpoint}

	\section{Avoiding Branchy Code Evaluation}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			Trying to detect branch-heavy computations and help the tracer forgo them seems like a promising idea.

			Partial evaluation, as generally a common technique in tracing JITs to improve performance, is not a great idea for meta-tracing.

	\section{Getting Better at Branch-Heavy Code Evaluation}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			The nature of this type of computation makes it a fundamental problem for meta-tracing (aforementioned in earlier chapters). There's not much to do to get better at this.

			A different model of computation (e.g., a stackful model alongside CEK) could mitigate memory issues.

		- Redex model investigating stack/heap balance
