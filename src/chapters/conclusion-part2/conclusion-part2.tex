\chapter{Conclusion of Part II}

	\begin{mainpoint}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item We revealed and analyzed a fundamental problem with self-hosting on meta-tracing JITs and argued it is solvable, proposing solution avenues clearly worth further study.  This is a significant contribution to PL research.
			\item We detailed a big problem in tracing JITs in general--you lose more when slow than you gain when fast, especially in branch-heavy code--and showed why solving it would be a major contribution.
		\end{itemize}
