\chapter{Conclusion of Part II}

	\begin{mainpoint}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item We revealed and analyzed a significant and fundamental problem with 
		self-hosting languages on meta-tracing JIT compilers, and argued that
		it is indeed solvable, by proposing some solution approaches, evidently
		worthy of further looking into. 
		Step towards solving this problem is a significant contribution to 
		programming language research.
			\item We detailed one of the biggest problems in tracing JIT compilers in general
		(you lose more when slow than you gain when fast, especially in branch-heavy code), 
		which is largely responsible for people being deterred from
		investing in tracing JIT compilers in the last decade. Step
		towards solving this is a significant contribution.
