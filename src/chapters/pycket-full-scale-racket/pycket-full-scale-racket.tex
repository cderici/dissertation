\chapter{Full-Scale Language Self-Hosting}

    \begin{chapterpoint}

        First part of the thesis statement, the self-hosting hypothesis:

        \textit{Self-hosting of full-scale functional languages on meta-tracing just-in-time (JIT) compilers is achievable.}
    \end{chapterpoint}

    \section{Growing a runtime into a total language implementation}

        \begin{mainpoint}
            A rudimentary interpreter can be bootstrapped into a full language implementation by importing linklets into the runtime.
        \end{mainpoint}

    \section{Assembling the Complete Language on the Host} 

        \begin{mainpoint}
            How it's all tied up together to demonstrate the self-hosting hypothesis.
