	\paragraph{}% 1
  		A practical programming language typically consists of three essential components: first, a \emph{language grammar} defining the syntax—expressions that can be formed; second, \emph{core language semantics}, which determine the meaning of these expressions, typically via reduction rules mapping expressions to values; and third, a \emph{runtime} responsible for realizing these semantics on a computing environment. The runtime provides mechanisms to read and expand user expressions, evaluate them, and produce values, effectively bridging the gap between abstract language semantics and concrete execution.

	\paragraph{}% 2
  		The \emph{portability} of a programming language refers to its ability to be adapted to run on different runtimes or virtual machines. This notion is distinct from having multiple independent implementations of a language. Rather, portability implies deliberate support at the language's syntax or semantic level, enabling runtimes to more easily adopt the language's core implementation. Languages that explicitly expose an intermediate form or semantics conducive to plugging into different backend runtimes exemplify this approach. Notable examples include Haskell, whose \gls{ghc} toolchain reduces every module to an intermediate typed Core IR, facilitating easy backend integration such as \gls{llvm}~\cite{ghc_llvm_backend}; and Common Lisp, particularly implementations like Clasp, which retain high-level runtime elements (macro expander, reader) in Lisp while swapping only the code generator~\cite{clasp_llvm}. Such designs demonstrate how exposing an intermediate representation at the language level significantly simplifies retargeting efforts, reducing engineering overhead.


	\paragraph{Future-proofing and platform agility}% 3
		When language semantics are lowered to a portable, implementation-independent \gls{ir}, targeting new \glspl{vm} typically involves writing a minimal backend rather than a complete compiler. For instance, the \gls{ghc} gained support for ARM, PowerPC, and WebAssembly virtually \smartQL for free\smartQR upon integrating \gls{llvm}~\cite{ghc_llvm_backend}. Reducing engineering costs per new target ensures the language remains viable across evolving hardware ecosystems, preserving the investments made by implementers and users.

	\paragraph{Tooling \& ecosystem leverage}% 4
		A standardized, information-rich IR allows external tools—such as optimizers, verifiers, and profilers—to uniformly support all eventual backends. Compiler research demonstrates that most optimization efforts naturally gravitate toward the IR layer because benefits propagate globally~\cite{ir_cacm}. Recent advances, such as the SMACK verifier, illustrate that languages emitting \gls{llvm} \gls{ir} immediately gain powerful, cross-language verification capabilities without rewriting analysis tools for each source language~\cite{llvm_verification}. Hence, language-level portability not only expands the range of deployment targets but also enhances the reuse potential of infrastructure and tooling around the language.

	\paragraph{}% 5
  		Improving language portability fundamentally relies on enhancing semantic communication between the language's core semantics and its runtime. Clear, explicit interfaces or intermediate representations are required for languages to effectively instruct runtimes on realizing their semantics, rather than each runtime manually handling tight couplings such as macro expansion, serialization, or user-level threading models.

	\paragraph{}%  6
		In this chapter, we examine improvements to language portability, using Racket's linklets as a concrete example. We introduce a formal specification along with an executable PLT Redex model to describe the operational semantics of linklets. This formalism forms the basis for understanding how self-hosting is achieved in the meta-tracing JIT-compiled Pycket implementation described in \chapterRef{chapter:pycket}, supporting the main thesis statement.


	\section[\texorpdfstring{Enriching Compiler \& Runtime Communication}{Motivation for Linklets}]{Enriching Compiler \& Runtime Communication}

		\paragraph{}% 1
			A tight coupling exists between the runtime and the reduction semantics of a programming language. This coupling arises because the runtime must concretely implement the abstract semantics specified by the language. For example, languages with macro systems may require runtimes to adopt specialized parsing mechanisms to handle macro expansions, differing from standard reading approaches. Similarly, custom serialization semantics defined by a language necessitate that the runtime can correctly serialize and deserialize language-specific objects. Additionally, languages that define semantics for user-level (green) threads demand explicit runtime support for mapping these constructs to \gls{os} threads. Clearly specifying these interactions is essential for streamlined and efficient language implementations.

		\paragraph{}% 2
			Without explicit support from the language itself, each runtime that aims to implement the language must manually reconstruct all of these intricate interactions. Such manual reconstruction is costly, error-prone, and challenging to maintain, especially since subtle changes in language semantics often require extensive adjustments within the runtime. Consequently, portability becomes limited, forcing each runtime to independently handle the complexities inherent in language semantics. Therefore, introducing a mechanism to mitigate these difficulties would significantly improve portability.

		\paragraph{}% 3
			Racket is a good example that successfully leverages such a mechanism to significantly enhance its portability. In 2019, Racket transitioned to Chez Scheme as its primary runtime and introduced a structured intermediate representation called \emph{linklets} as units of compilation, designed to simplify the runtime implementation~\cite{icfp2019}. Linklets, discussed in detail in the next section, streamlined the process of re-targeting Racket to Chez Scheme and established a robust foundation for self-hosting on other platforms, directly aligning with our thesis.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{racket-on-chez-3-stacks-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 4
			The transition of Racket to Chez Scheme is illustrated in \figref{fig:racket-on-chez}. To concretely improve portability, Racket shifted several high-level components—initially and most notably the macro expander—from a C-based implementation to Racket itself. The left-most column of \figref{fig:racket-on-chez} highlights the first ever version of Racket with its expander implemented in Racket. The macro expander defines critical functionality, including the macro system, module system, reader, and code expansion and elaboration. It is the essential component enabling reading and elaborating Racket code, thereby it plays a central role in supporting self-hosting of the language.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{racket-expand-example-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 5
			Furthermore, the expander transforms Racket code into a core \gls{ir} designed explicitly for consumption by the hosting runtime. This intermediate representation closely resembles $\lambda$-calculus with some syntactic extensions. Instead of conventional \racketcode{lambda} forms, which consume and produce values, this intermediate form employs \racketcode{linklet} forms that consume and produce potentially mutable variables. By strictly segregating evaluation phases (e.g., compile-time versus run-time), the expander produces distinct linklets corresponding to different phases for a given Racket module. \figref{fig:racket-expand-example} demonstrates this elaboration with an example module, showing distinct linklets for expansion-time (compile-time), run-time, and literal syntax objects to bridge these phases.

		\paragraph{}% 6
			The bundle of linklets generated for a Racket module can subsequently be flattened into a single, self-contained runtime linklet. This way, Racket applies the macro expander to each layer of high-level functionality to produce self-contained linklets that can be exported offline by the language. For example, applying the macro expander to itself produces an independent linklet that encapsulates all subsystems essential for bootstrapping Racket, such as the module and macro systems. We will refer to the high-level functionalities that are exported in this way together as the \emph{bootstrapping linklets} in the rest of the dissertation.

		\paragraph{}% 7
			Given the bootstrapping linklets, a runtime that aims to implement Racket needs only to understand how to compile and execute serialized linklets to turn into a full runtime for the language. By loading these linklets, a runtime instantly acquires Racket's entire high-level functionalities, such as the macro and module system, \racketcode{read}, \racketcode{expand}, and more without having to explicitly reimplement them separately. Consequently, it gains the capacity to self-host Racket, by utilizing the module system to locate and load the core Racket libraries, and reading and expanding all the modules to load a Racket language (e.g. \emph{racket/base}), fully supporting Racket’s semantics. In \chapterRef{chapter:pycket} we present this process in detail by which we turn Pycket into a full Racket implementation.

		\paragraph{}% 8
			In the next section, we delve into the semantics of the central construct enabling this enhanced portability—linklets. We present a formal operational semantics for linklets and describe an executable PLT Redex model that captures their compilation and execution semantics.

	\section[\texorpdfstring{Linklets as Units of Compilation}{Using Linklets}]{Linklets as Units of Compilation}
		\label{section:linklet-semantics}

		\paragraph{}% 1
			In this section, we introduce \emph{linklets} as a language form and provide both formal operational semantics and a minimal \gls{api} that a \gls{vm} must implement to support them. We also demonstrate through a practical example how linklets facilitate interesting runtime functionalities, laying the groundwork for improved compiler-runtime communication and, eventually, self-hosting.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{linklet-source-language-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 2
			A \emph{linklet}, as depicted in \figref{fig:linklet-grammar}, is a lambda-like binding construct composed of three primary components: a set of imported variables, a set of exported variables, and a body containing definitions and expressions. Real-world examples of linklets, represented as s-expressions, can be seen in \figref{fig:racket-expand-example}. Imported variables allow linklets to utilize external definitions, while exported variables provide definitions to other linklets. Notably, the exported set can include variables without corresponding definitions in the body, enabling dynamic binding resolution at runtime.

		\paragraph{}% 3
			Linklets as standalone s-expressions are no more inherently meaningful than a conventional \racketcode{lambda} expression. But when \emph{compiled} by a hosting runtime into a linklet object, a linklet becomes ready for \emph{instantiation}, a process analogous to a function application, wherein imported variables are provided, and the linklet body expressions are sequentially evaluated. Instantiation can occur in two modes that we will refer to as \emph{regular instantiation} and \emph{targeted instantiation} in the rest of the chapter, each resulting in different outcomes.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{basic-linklet-instantiation-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 4
			Regular instantiation is where a linklet evaluates its body after receiving imported variables from other linklet instances. As illustrated in \figref{fig:regular-linklet-instantiation}, regular instantiation produces a fresh \emph{linklet instance}, which serves as a container holding exported variables and additional runtime data such as namespaces. The resulting linklet instance subsequently provides its variables to other linklet instantiations.

		\paragraph{}% 5
			A targeted instantiation, by contrast, is where a linklet is provided with a pre-existing \emph{target} instance alongside linklet instances for the imported variables. In this case, the variables in the target instance is used and modified for the linklet definitions and expressions during the evaluation of the expressions within the linklet body. This kind of instantiation is often used for side-effects, and the result is the value of the last expression in the linklet rather than a new linklet instance.

		\paragraph{}% 6
			The linklet design does not impose a specific internal representation, allowing a \gls{vm} flexibility in selecting preferred representations for linklets and instances. For example, Chez Scheme represents linklets as Scheme functions, whereas Pycket employs a custom runtime class named \pycketcode{W\_Linklet}. To manage these diverse representations uniformly, Racket specifies a minimal runtime \gls{api} for \glspl{vm}, comprising two functions: \racketcode{compile-linklet} for preparing linklets and \racketcode{instantiate-linklet} for executing them.

		\paragraph{}% 7
			Loading linklets into a \gls{vm} runtime involves compiling linklet s-expressions into runtime objects and subsequently instantiating these objects to obtain their exported variables. Specifically, \racketcode{compile-linklet} transforms linklet s-expressions into runtime objects containing the runtime AST for the enclosed code. Once instantiated, all exported variables become immediately available to other linklets via the resulting instance. These variables can encapsulate any Racket value, including callable closures, allowing the runtime to directly invoke powerful functions without explicitly reimplementing them, such as the \racketcode{expand} function from the expander linklet.


		\subsection{Using Linklets: A Small Top-level REPL Interaction}
		\label{subsec:toplevel-example}

		\paragraph{}% 8
			To clarify and illustrate the semantics of linklets in a more concrete manner, we introduce a small yet informative example of how a \gls{vm} implements a high-level Racket feature using linklets: the top-level \gls{repl}. Although the top-level implementation itself is quite complex and beyond our scope, this example demonstrates clearly how the runtime utilizes high-level features provided via linklets—particularly those exported by the expander, including \racketcode{read}, \racketcode{expand}, and \racketcode{eval}—to create a \gls{repl} behavior.

		\paragraph{}% 9
			As a running example, consider the following simple \gls{repl} interaction, in which a closure \racketcode{k} references an initially undefined variable \racketcode{a}. Subsequently, the variable \racketcode{a} is defined, and the closure is invoked, yielding the result 10. This scenario is intended to illustrate how linklets implement dynamic variable bindings.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-interaction-listing}

		\paragraph{}% 10
			This interaction, despite seemingly contradicting lexical scoping, is perfectly valid within \gls{repl} environments, which are historically designed to evaluate expressions incrementally within mutable top-level namespaces. Such environments allow the definition of constructs like mutually recursive functions in a step-by-step manner. To simulate this dynamic behavior, our \gls{vm} maintains a dedicated \emph{top-level} linklet instance, initially empty, that serves as a mutable namespace for dynamically defining and modifying variables throughout the \gls{repl} session.

		\paragraph{}% 11
			At each interaction step in the \gls{repl}, the VM receives a Racket s-expression to evaluate. It first applies Racket's \racketcode{read} and \racketcode{expand} functions—provided by the expander linklet—to convert the s-expression into a linklet. This newly generated linklet is then compiled using \racketcode{compile-linklet} into a linklet object, which undergoes targeted instantiation with the top-level instance as its target. \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step} shows the generated and compiled linklets along with the updated state of the environment and top-level instance after each step\footnote{For clarity, we will omit the non-essential details and focus only on the simplified run-time linklet for the expression}.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-step-by-step-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 12
			Each step in the \gls{repl} involves dynamically using Racket's own \racketcode{read} and \racketcode{expand} functions provided by the expander linklet, rather than runtime-specific implementations. This demonstrates a core advantage of linklets, allowing the runtime to leverage the high-level functionalities directly exported from Racket itself, significantly simplifying the runtime's implementation burden.

		\paragraph{}% 13
			An interesting point about the top-level in this example is the handling of the undefined identifier \racketcode{a}. When the runtime compiles a linklet containing such an identifier, it designates that identifier as an exported variable of the linklet (despite having no corresponding definition for it). During the compilation, a new linklet variable is created for it with the special value \emph{uninitialized} (e.g. $var_a$ in our example). When the runtime for later refers to such an identifier, it will be dynamically provided using the \emph{target} instance (in this case using the top-level instance), essentially forming a low-level dynamic scope. Note that in the first row of the \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step}, we have the variable mappings for both \racketcode{a} and the \racketcode{k} within the target instance after the instantiation. They contain the values \racketcode{uninitialized} and a closure with no arguments and body with a reference to $var_a$ respectively.

		\paragraph{}% 14
			Since each instantiation within the \gls{repl} is a targeted instantiation, changes made to the top-level instance persist across interactions. For instance, after the second interaction step depicted in \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step}, \racketcode{a}'s value (10) is directly assigned to $var_a$ via a \racketcode{variable-set!} operation in the compiled linklet. If $var_a$ had not existed in the top-level instance initially, a new variable initialized as \emph{uninitialized} would have been created (as occurred in the first interaction). In this case, however, since $var_a$ existed, it was simply updated to hold the new value.

		\paragraph{}% 15
			At the third interaction step, when executing the closure \racketcode{k}, the identifier \racketcode{a} inside the closure is dynamically resolved to the $var_a$ via the \racketcode{variable-ref} call inside the compiled linklet. Then the runtime consults the \emph{target} top-level instance to obtain \racketcode{a}'s current value (10), already set thanks to the previous step. This demonstrates linklets' flexibility in managing runtime variable bindings across dynamic execution contexts.

		\paragraph{}% 16
			This dynamic interplay of linklets is made possible by the clever use of linklet variables and target instances, specified by the semantics that are embedded in the \racketcode{compile-linklet}. In the subsequent section, we present these formal operational semantics in detail, underpinning the correctness and robustness of linklet interactions and their use in runtime implementations.


	\section[\texorpdfstring{Formal Operational Semantics of Linklets}{Formal Semantics for Linklets}]{Formal Operational Semantics of Linklets}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 1
			In this section we present a formalism to describe the operational semantics of linklets, which is the basis of the implementation on Pycket, that'll be discussed in the subsequent chapter. The formalism is developed in the PLT Redex language, therefore it is executable \cite{redexBook}. Randomized testing is used to verify the model \cite{randomizedTesting}.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 2
			\figref{fig:linklet-grammar} shows the grammar of the linklet
			language\footnote{Some rules (e.g. evaluation contexts etc.) are omitted for clarity.}, which is a minimal subset of the fully expanded Racket
			programs, extended with the \verb|linklet| form and top-level
			definitions (i.e. \racketcode{define-values}). In addition to the basic forms such
			as \racketcode{begin}, \racketcode{set!}, \racketcode{if} etc., the linklet language has
			some additional forms to manipulate variables
			(e.g. \emph{var-ref}), as shown in \verb|e| rule. We will go into details about these forms that manipulate variables when we talk about \racketcode{compile-linklet} semantics shortly. For clarity, we'll refer to the variables manipulated specifically by the linklets as \emph{linklet variables}. In reality there's no semantic distinction between a regular variable and a linklet variable, i.e. they can both be represented by cells in the runtime.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 3
			The sub-language that is used within the linklet body,
			namely the \gls{lkl} is essentially a $\lambda$-calculus with a handful
			of syntactic extensions. A grammar, a standard reduction relation, as well as an evaluator for \gls{lkl} (that the reduction semantics for linklets refer to) is provided in \appendixRef{appendix:linklet-kernel-language}.

			\gls{lkl} is a subset of the Racket \racketcode{\#\%kernel} language, which makes a rudimentary Racket interpreter a perfect candidate to support linklets by only adding the linklet specific semantics and nothing more.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\inputFigure{linklets}{linklet-runtime-language-figure}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 4
			\figref{fig:linklet-runtime-language} illustrates the runtime representations of compiled linklets and linklet instances. Given a linklet L, \racketcode{compile-linklet} produces a linklet object $\la$ that is ready to be instantiated. $\la$ consists of \emph{Import} and \emph{Export} objects for the identifiers denoting the imported and exported variables respectively. We're only interested in compiling forms related to linklets, so we omit, for the sake of clarity, any compilation details of turning s-expressions of basic forms (e.g. \racketcode{begin}, \racketcode{set!}) into runtime \glspl{ast}. Furthermore, the body expressions containing additional expressions created during the compilation for dynamic variable manipulations in the run-time are elaborated below.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 5

			Before a linklet is ready for the \racketcode{compile-linklet}, several passes over the linklet are
			performed to ensure a correct information flow between the variables
			in the run-time.  For each imported and exported identifier (also keeping
			their corresponding renamings if any), \emph{Import} and
			\emph{Export} objects are created with the fresh (gensymed) references that
			will be used for the variables that are dynamically created during
			instantiation. Additionally, all the defined identifiers, as well as the set of mutated ones are collected by a pass on the linklet body.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 6
			compile-linklet

			Given a set of \emph{Import}s ($\mathit{C_I}$), a set of
			\emph{Export}s ($\mathit{C_E}$), a set of top-level defined
			identifiers ($\mathit{X_T}$) and a set of mutated identifiers
			($\mathit{X_M}$), the compilation starts to process each expression in
			the linklet body one by one. Each \emph{Import} and \emph{Export} object consists of two
			identifiers that are internal and external with respect to the linklet
			body (to accommodate renamings), and one fresh identifier for internal
			use during the instantiation.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\inputFigure{linklets}{compile-linklet-transformation-rules-table}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 7
			\tableRef{table:linklet-compilation-rules} lists the transformation rules for the linklet variables used in \racketcode{compile-linklet} semantics. Any exported and top-level-defined identifier is related to a linklet variable that's assumed to be created later during instantiation. An exported identifier that's a target of a \racketcode{set!} is transformed to be mutated at runtime by a \racketcode{var-set/check-undef!} operation. References to the imported variables are also related to runtime linklet variables. Additionally, an exported identifier that is either mutated, or doesn't have a definition in the linklet also turned into a linklet variable reference, as that will likely be provided by the target instance during instantiation.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 8
			instantiate-linklet

			The \emph{Import} and \emph{Export}
			objects are processed as the first step of the instantiation. References for the imported variables are collected from
			the given import instances, and additional variables may be created
			for exported variables depending on the target instance as we have
			shown in the example in \secref{subsec:toplevel-example}. For notational convenience in presenting the semantics, $\lb$ in \figref{fig:linklet-runtime-language}
			denotes a compiled linklet object after such a preparation step. Note that $\lb$ doesn't contain any import and export objects, as they are already resolved during this transition. After such a $\lb$ is constructed, an instantiation may proceed.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 9
			Recall that a linklet instantiation can happen in two separate ways; regular instantiation that results in a linklet instance, and a targeted instantiation that results in a single value output, often used for modifications on the given target. As a part of the preparation step in \racketcode{compile-linklet} during transitioning from $\la$ to $\lb$, a target instance that's used during the instantiation is plugged into the $\lb$ (again, for notational convenience in presenting the semantics). If this is a targeted instantiation, then the target instance is already provided to the \racketcode{instantiate-linklet} operation. Otherwise, a fresh empty instance is created and used during instantiation. For simplicity, the result of both instantiations is a pair of the last expression’s value and the target instance being used.
		\end{paragraph-here}


		\begin{paragraph-here}
			Since the linklets are lambda\dash like binding forms and not capable
			of starting a computation by themselves, we introduce a top\dash level
			form, namely \racketcode{program}. A \racketcode{program} consists of
			a set of given linklets to be loaded and a single top\dash level
			expression to perform a computation. \figref{fig:linklet-program}
			shows part of the grammar for \racketcode{program}s. We provided
			the \racketcode{let-inst} form to name a linklet instance,
			and \racketcode{seq} form to perform multiple computations in
			sequence.

		\end{figure-here}


		\begin{paragraph-here}
			As an example, we can represent the top-level repl example from the
			previous section as a linklet \emph{program}, and simulate the
			process. The (multi-step) reduction below demonstrate the compilation of each
			linklet, representing the linklets produced by the expander at each
			repl interaction. After the compilation, the linklets are substitiuted
			in the body and the evaluation starts with reducing the
			body. \figref{fig:reduction} shows the reduction relation, $\beta_p$, that
			implements the evaluation, together with the reduction relation for
			RC, $\beta_r$. For clarity, the reduction of the programs and the linklet
			instantiation is defined together by the same relation ($\beta_p$) so that
			the whole evaluation generating a single small-step sequence of
			reductions from programs to values.
		\end{paragraph-here}


		\begin{paragraph-here}
			After the compilation and loading phase, all the linklet objects are
			in $\la$ form and ready to be instantiated. Recall that a linklet
			instantiation has two modes; \textbf{i)} regular instantiation, where
			a new instance is being created and returned, and \textbf{ii)}
			targeted instantiation, where the given target instance is used during
			the instantiation. Since the only difference between the two modes is
			the return value, for simplicity in the model we remove the
			distinction by turning the regular instantiation into a targeted
			instantiation with a fresh empty instance. The result of both the
			instantiation is then a pair of the last expression's value and the
			target instance being used.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}
			At the start of instantiation, the imported variables are collected
			from the given linklet instances by simply going through each set of
			\emph{Import} objects in the $\la$ and the corresponding linklet
			instance that provides the variables. The collected variable
			references are then put into the environment with the names in the
			corresponding \emph{Import} objects that were generated for the
			variables during the compilation. Recall that a linklet may export a
			variable despite having no corresponding definition for it. This is
			achieved by for each \emph{Export} object in $\la$ grabbing the
			variable from the target instance if it has a mapping for it and
			making it available in the environment. Otherwise a fresh variable is
			created and its mapping is placed into the environment and into the
			target instance as well.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}
			After processing the import and export variables, the $\la$ object is
			reduced into $\lb$, which triggers the evaluation of the expressions
			in the linklet body. The linklet compilation makes sure that every
			variable reference within the body uses the appropriate variable, and
			at the beginning of the instantiation the preparation of the import
			and export variables explained above provides the actual variables in
			the environment to be modified and used. The reduction then proceeds
			with the evaluation of the body expressions one-by-one. After all the
			expressions are processed, a pair of the last expression's value and
			the reference to the target instance is returned. The reduction of the
			program continues by similarly instantiating the other two linklets
			and finally returning the last value in the
			\verb|seq| form.

\section*{\thesection\quad Conclusion}

	\begin{paragraph-here}
		The ability to provide high-level functionalities to runtime is one of the key ideas in improving portability.


		The ability to provide high-level functionalities as callable functions to the hosting virtual machine is one of the key ideas in improving Racket’s portability. A VM that wants to host Racket not only gets the high-level implementations such as the module system, macro system for free, but also gets highly re-usable functionalities that it can integrate the systems it implements, such as the top-level repl example in Figure 16.
	\end{paragraph-here}

	\begin{paragraph-here}
		Interplay between the language and the runtime is cool.


		Moreover, Racket implements and exports abstract functionalities that are tightly coupled with the hosting runtime as well. For instance the expander linklet provides the eval function, which is basically an abstract interpreter for Racket. A VM that hosts Racket can call eval, which interprets Racket code by using the run-time primitives and compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet that are implemented and provided by the VM itself. Therefore, one of the essential nuances of self-hosting Racket with the expander linklet, is that the interaction between the run-time and the expander is a two-way street. The VM implements and uses compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet to import the functions provided by the expander, and the expander provides functions that uses the compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet functions, along with the other run-time primitives as well.
	\end{paragraph-here}

	\begin{paragraph-here}
		Interplay between the language and the runtime is cool. Merge with the previous paragraph.

		For example, the dynamic-require used above (provided by the expander linklet) is a Racket function that dynamically loads a Racket module (if it’s not already loaded) by resolving the module path, finding the source code in the file system, reading and expanding the codes and modifying the namespace registry. The Racket code inside the expander that implements all that, calls run-time primitives such as for file-system support and also calls the compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet for expanding and instantiating all the required modules. eval works in a similar fashion as well. This intertwined nature of the high-level language facilities and the low-level run-time support is central to the Racket’s improved portability.
