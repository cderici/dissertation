  		A practical programming language typically consists of three essential components: first, a \emph{language grammar} defining the syntax—expressions that can be formed; second, \emph{core language semantics}, which determine the meaning of these expressions, typically via reduction rules mapping expressions to values; and third, a \emph{runtime} responsible for realizing these semantics on a computing environment. The runtime provides mechanisms to read and expand user expressions, evaluate them, and produce values, effectively bridging the gap between abstract language semantics and concrete execution.

	\paragraph{}% 2
  		The \emph{portability} of a programming language refers to its ability to be adapted to run on different runtimes or virtual machines. This notion is distinct from having multiple independent implementations of a language. Rather, portability implies deliberate support at the language's syntax or semantic level, enabling runtimes to more easily adopt the language's core implementation. Languages that explicitly expose an intermediate form or semantics conducive to plugging into different backend runtimes exemplify this approach. Notable examples include Haskell, whose \gls{ghc} toolchain reduces every module to an intermediate typed Core IR, facilitating easy backend integration such as \gls{llvm}~\cite{ghc_llvm_backend}; and Common Lisp, particularly implementations like Clasp, which retain high-level runtime elements (macro expander, reader) in Lisp while swapping only the code generator~\cite{clasp_llvm}. Such designs demonstrate how exposing an intermediate representation at the language level significantly simplifies retargeting efforts, reducing engineering overhead.


	\paragraph{Future-proofing and platform agility}% 3
		When language semantics are lowered to a portable, implementation-independent \gls{ir}, targeting new \glspl{vm} typically involves writing a minimal backend rather than a complete compiler. For instance, the \gls{ghc} gained support for ARM, PowerPC, and WebAssembly virtually \smartQL for free\smartQR upon integrating \gls{llvm}~\cite{ghc_llvm_backend}. Reducing engineering costs per new target ensures the language remains viable across evolving hardware ecosystems, preserving the investments made by implementers and users.

	\paragraph{Tooling \& ecosystem leverage}% 4
		A standardized, information-rich IR allows external tools—such as optimizers, verifiers, and profilers—to uniformly support all eventual backends. Compiler research demonstrates that most optimization efforts naturally gravitate toward the IR layer because benefits propagate globally~\cite{ir_cacm}. Recent advances, such as the SMACK verifier, illustrate that languages emitting \gls{llvm} \gls{ir} immediately gain powerful, cross-language verification capabilities without rewriting analysis tools for each source language~\cite{llvm_verification}. Hence, language-level portability not only expands the range of deployment targets but also enhances the reuse potential of infrastructure and tooling around the language.

	\paragraph{}% 5
  		Improving language portability fundamentally relies on enhancing semantic communication between the language's core semantics and its runtime. Clear, explicit interfaces or intermediate representations are required for languages to effectively instruct runtimes on realizing their semantics, rather than each runtime manually handling tight couplings such as macro expansion, serialization, or user-level threading models.

	\paragraph{}%  6
		In this chapter, we examine improvements to language portability, using Racket's linklets as a concrete example. We introduce a formal specification along with an executable PLT Redex model to describe the operational semantics of linklets. This formalism forms the basis for understanding how self-hosting is achieved in the meta-tracing JIT-compiled Pycket implementation described in \chapterRef{chapter:pycket}, supporting the main thesis statement.


	\section[\texorpdfstring{Enriching Compiler \& Runtime Communication}{Motivation for Linklets}]{Enriching Compiler \& Runtime Communication}

		\paragraph{}% 1
			A tight coupling exists between the runtime and the reduction semantics of a programming language. This coupling arises because the runtime must concretely implement the abstract semantics specified by the language. For example, languages with macro systems may require runtimes to adopt specialized parsing mechanisms to handle macro expansions, differing from standard reading approaches. Similarly, custom serialization semantics defined by a language necessitate that the runtime can correctly serialize and deserialize language-specific objects. Additionally, languages that define semantics for user-level (green) threads demand explicit runtime support for mapping these constructs to \gls{os} threads. Clearly specifying these interactions is essential for streamlined and efficient language implementations.

		\paragraph{}% 2
			Without explicit support from the language itself, each runtime that aims to implement the language must manually reconstruct all of these intricate interactions. Such manual reconstruction is costly, error-prone, and challenging to maintain, especially since subtle changes in language semantics often require extensive adjustments within the runtime. Consequently, portability becomes limited, forcing each runtime to independently handle the complexities inherent in language semantics. Therefore, introducing a mechanism to mitigate these difficulties would significantly improve portability.

		\paragraph{}% 3
			Racket is a good example that successfully leverages such a mechanism to significantly enhance its portability. In 2019, Racket transitioned to Chez Scheme as its primary runtime and introduced a structured intermediate representation called \emph{linklets} as units of compilation, designed to simplify the runtime implementation~\cite{icfp2019}. Linklets, discussed in detail in the next section, streamlined the process of re-targeting Racket to Chez Scheme and established a robust foundation for self-hosting on other platforms, directly aligning with our thesis.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{racket-on-chez-3-stacks-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 4
			The transition of Racket to Chez Scheme is illustrated in \figref{fig:racket-on-chez}. To concretely improve portability, Racket shifted several high-level components—initially and most notably the macro expander—from a C-based implementation to Racket itself. The left-most column of \figref{fig:racket-on-chez} highlights the first ever version of Racket with its expander implemented in Racket. The macro expander defines critical functionality, including the macro system, module system, reader, and code expansion and elaboration. It is the essential component enabling reading and elaborating Racket code, thereby it plays a central role in supporting self-hosting of the language.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{racket-expand-example-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 5
			Furthermore, the expander transforms Racket code into a core \gls{ir} designed explicitly for consumption by the hosting runtime. This intermediate representation closely resembles $\lambda$-calculus with some syntactic extensions. Instead of conventional \racketcode{lambda} forms, which consume and produce values, this intermediate form employs \racketcode{linklet} forms that consume and produce potentially mutable variables. By strictly segregating evaluation phases (e.g., compile-time versus run-time), the expander produces distinct linklets corresponding to different phases for a given Racket module. \figref{fig:racket-expand-example} demonstrates this elaboration with an example module, showing distinct linklets for expansion-time (compile-time), run-time, and literal syntax objects to bridge these phases.

		\paragraph{}% 6
			The bundle of linklets generated for a Racket module can subsequently be flattened into a single, self-contained runtime linklet. This way, Racket applies the macro expander to each layer of high-level functionality to produce self-contained linklets that can be exported offline by the language. For example, applying the macro expander to itself produces an independent linklet that encapsulates all subsystems essential for bootstrapping Racket, such as the module and macro systems. We will refer to the high-level functionalities that are exported in this way together as the \emph{bootstrapping linklets} in the rest of the dissertation.

		\paragraph{}% 7
			Given the bootstrapping linklets, a runtime that aims to implement Racket needs only to understand how to compile and execute serialized linklets to turn into a full runtime for the language. By loading these linklets, a runtime instantly acquires Racket's entire high-level functionalities, such as the macro and module system, \racketcode{read}, \racketcode{expand}, and more without having to explicitly reimplement them separately. Consequently, it gains the capacity to self-host Racket, by utilizing the module system to locate and load the core Racket libraries, and reading and expanding all the modules to load a Racket language (e.g. \emph{racket/base}), fully supporting Racket’s semantics. In \chapterRef{chapter:pycket} we present this process in detail by which we turn Pycket into a full Racket implementation.

		\paragraph{}% 8
			In the next section, we delve into the semantics of the central construct enabling this enhanced portability—linklets. We present a formal operational semantics for linklets and describe an executable PLT Redex model that captures their compilation and execution semantics.

	\section[\texorpdfstring{Linklets as Units of Compilation}{Using Linklets}]{Linklets as Units of Compilation}
		\label{section:linklet-semantics}

		\paragraph{}% 1
			In this section, we introduce \emph{linklets} as a language form and provide both formal operational semantics and a minimal \gls{api} that a \gls{vm} must implement to support them. We also demonstrate through a practical example how linklets facilitate interesting runtime functionalities, laying the groundwork for improved compiler-runtime communication and, eventually, self-hosting.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{linklet-source-language-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 2
			A \emph{linklet}, as depicted in \figref{fig:linklet-grammar}, is a lambda-like binding construct composed of three primary components: a set of imported variables, a set of exported variables, and a body containing definitions and expressions. Real-world examples of linklets, represented as s-expressions, can be seen in \figref{fig:racket-expand-example}. Imported variables allow linklets to utilize external definitions, while exported variables provide definitions to other linklets. Notably, the exported set can include variables without corresponding definitions in the body, enabling dynamic binding resolution at runtime.

		\paragraph{}% 3
			Linklets as standalone s-expressions are no more inherently meaningful than a conventional \racketcode{lambda} expression. But when \emph{compiled} by a hosting runtime into a linklet object, a linklet becomes ready for \emph{instantiation}, a process analogous to a function application, wherein imported variables are provided, and the linklet body expressions are sequentially evaluated. Instantiation can occur in two modes that we will refer to as \emph{regular instantiation} and \emph{targeted instantiation} in the rest of the chapter, each resulting in different outcomes.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{basic-linklet-instantiation-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 4
			Regular instantiation is where a linklet evaluates its body after receiving imported variables from other linklet instances. As illustrated in \figref{fig:regular-linklet-instantiation}, regular instantiation produces a fresh \emph{linklet instance}, which serves as a container holding exported variables and additional runtime data such as namespaces. The resulting linklet instance subsequently provides its variables to other linklet instantiations.

		\paragraph{}% 5
			A targeted instantiation, by contrast, is where a linklet is provided with a pre-existing \emph{target} instance alongside linklet instances for the imported variables. In this case, the variables in the target instance is used and modified for the linklet definitions and expressions during the evaluation of the expressions within the linklet body. This kind of instantiation is often used for side-effects, and the result is the value of the last expression in the linklet rather than a new linklet instance.

		\paragraph{}% 6
			The linklet design does not impose a specific internal representation, allowing a \gls{vm} flexibility in selecting preferred representations for linklets and instances. For example, Chez Scheme represents linklets as Scheme functions, whereas Pycket employs a custom runtime class named \pycketcode{W\_Linklet}. To manage these diverse representations uniformly, Racket specifies a minimal runtime \gls{api} for \glspl{vm}, comprising two functions: \racketcode{compile-linklet} for preparing linklets and \racketcode{instantiate-linklet} for executing them.

		\paragraph{}% 7
			Loading linklets into a \gls{vm} runtime involves compiling linklet s-expressions into runtime objects and subsequently instantiating these objects to obtain their exported variables. Specifically, \racketcode{compile-linklet} transforms linklet s-expressions into runtime objects containing the runtime AST for the enclosed code. Once instantiated, all exported variables become immediately available to other linklets via the resulting instance. These variables can encapsulate any Racket value, including callable closures, allowing the runtime to directly invoke powerful functions without explicitly reimplementing them, such as the \racketcode{expand} function from the expander linklet.


		\subsection{Using Linklets: A Small Top-level REPL Interaction}
		\label{subsec:toplevel-example}

		\paragraph{}% 8
			To clarify and illustrate the semantics of linklets in a more concrete manner, we introduce a small yet informative example of how a \gls{vm} implements a high-level Racket feature using linklets: the top-level \gls{repl}. Although the top-level implementation itself is quite complex and beyond our scope, this example demonstrates clearly how the runtime utilizes high-level features provided via linklets—particularly those exported by the expander, including \racketcode{read}, \racketcode{expand}, and \racketcode{eval}—to create a \gls{repl} behavior.

		\paragraph{}% 9
			As a running example, consider the simple \gls{repl} interaction in \figref{fig:toplevel-example-repl-interactions}, in which a closure \racketcode{k} references an initially undefined variable \racketcode{a}. Subsequently, the variable \racketcode{a} is defined, and the closure is invoked, yielding the result 10. This scenario is intended to illustrate how linklets implement dynamic variable bindings.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-interaction-listing}

		\paragraph{}% 10
			This interaction, despite seemingly contradicting lexical scoping, is perfectly valid within \gls{repl} environments, which are historically designed to evaluate expressions incrementally within mutable top-level namespaces. Such environments allow the definition of constructs like mutually recursive functions in a step-by-step manner. To simulate this dynamic behavior, our \gls{vm} maintains a dedicated \emph{top-level} linklet instance, initially empty, that serves as a mutable namespace for dynamically defining and modifying variables throughout the \gls{repl} session.

		\paragraph{}% 11
			At each interaction step in the \gls{repl}, the VM receives a Racket s-expression to evaluate. It first applies Racket's \racketcode{read} and \racketcode{expand} functions—provided by the expander linklet—to convert the s-expression into a linklet. This newly generated linklet is then compiled using \racketcode{compile-linklet} into a linklet object, which undergoes targeted instantiation with the top-level instance as its target. \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step} shows the generated and compiled linklets along with the updated state of the environment and top-level instance after each step\footnote{For clarity, we will omit the non-essential details and focus only on the simplified run-time linklet for the expression}.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-step-by-step-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 12
			Each step in the \gls{repl} involves dynamically using Racket's own \racketcode{read} and \racketcode{expand} functions provided by the expander linklet, rather than runtime-specific implementations. This demonstrates a core advantage of linklets, allowing the runtime to leverage the high-level functionalities directly exported from Racket itself, significantly simplifying the runtime's implementation burden.

		\paragraph{}% 13
			An interesting point about the top-level in this example is the handling of the undefined identifier \racketcode{a}. When the runtime compiles a linklet containing such an identifier, it designates that identifier as an exported variable of the linklet (despite having no corresponding definition for it). During the compilation, a new linklet variable is created for it with the special value \emph{uninitialized} (e.g. $var_a$ in our example). When the runtime for later refers to such an identifier, it will be dynamically provided using the \emph{target} instance (in this case using the top-level instance), essentially forming a low-level dynamic scope. Note that in the first row of the \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step}, we have the variable mappings for both \racketcode{a} and the \racketcode{k} within the target instance after the instantiation. They contain the values \racketcode{uninitialized} and a closure with no arguments and body with a reference to $var_a$ respectively.

		\paragraph{}% 14
			Since each instantiation within the \gls{repl} is a targeted instantiation, changes made to the top-level instance persist across interactions. For instance, after the second interaction step depicted in \figref{fig:topevel-example-step-by-step}, \racketcode{a}'s value (10) is directly assigned to $var_a$ via a \racketcode{variable-set!} operation in the compiled linklet. If $var_a$ had not existed in the top-level instance initially, a new variable initialized as \emph{uninitialized} would have been created (as occurred in the first interaction). In this case, however, since $var_a$ existed, it was simply updated to hold the new value.

		\paragraph{}% 15
			At the third interaction step, when executing the closure \racketcode{k}, the identifier \racketcode{a} inside the closure is dynamically resolved to the $var_a$ via the \racketcode{variable-ref} call inside the compiled linklet. Then the runtime consults the \emph{target} top-level instance to obtain \racketcode{a}'s current value (10), already set thanks to the previous step. This demonstrates linklets' flexibility in managing runtime variable bindings across dynamic execution contexts.

		\paragraph{}% 16
			This dynamic interplay of linklets is made possible by the clever use of linklet variables and target instances, specified by the semantics that are embedded in the \racketcode{compile-linklet}. In the subsequent section, we present these formal operational semantics in detail, underpinning the correctness and robustness of linklet interactions and their use in runtime implementations.


	\section[\texorpdfstring{Formal Operational Semantics of Linklets}{Formal Semantics for Linklets}]{Formal Operational Semantics of Linklets}

		\paragraph{}% 1
			In this section, we present a formal specification of the operational semantics of linklets, which serves as the foundation for their implementation in Pycket, discussed in the following chapter (\chapterRef{chapter:pycket}). We develop this formalism using the PLT Redex language, making it executable and enabling rigorous validation through randomized testing~\cite{redexBook, randomizedTesting}. The validation methodology, including details of randomized testing and model correctness, is further elaborated in \chapterRef{chapter:validation}.

		\paragraph{}% 2
			The grammar of the linklet language, presented earlier in \figref{fig:linklet-grammar}, defines a minimal subset of fully-expanded Racket programs extended with the special \racketcode{linklet} form and top-level definitions (e.g., \racketcode{define-values}). Besides common forms like \racketcode{begin}, \racketcode{set!}, and \racketcode{if}, the grammar includes additional constructs specifically for manipulating variables (e.g., \racketcode{var-ref}), as shown in the rule for expressions (\verb|e|). These special constructs handle what we refer to as \emph{linklet variables}, which semantically behave just like regular variables in the runtime but are explicitly manipulated within linklets. We will detail these variable manipulation forms further when discussing the semantics of \racketcode{compile-linklet}.

		\paragraph{}% 3
			The sub-language used within a linklet body, which we refer to as \gls{lkl}, is essentially a $\lambda$-calculus enriched with a minimal set of syntactic extensions. We present the detailed grammar, a standard reduction relation, and an evaluator for \gls{lkl} in \appendixRef{appendix:linklet-kernel-language}, as these form the core language referred to by the linklet semantics. Importantly, \gls{lkl} aligns closely with Racket's \racketcode{\#\%kernel} language, thus any rudimentary interpreter for \racketcode{\#\%kernel} forms can easily be extended to support linklets by solely adding the linklet-specific semantics.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{linklet-runtime-language-figure}

		\paragraph{}% 4
			\figref{fig:linklet-runtime-language} illustrates the runtime representations for compiled linklets and linklet instances. Given a linklet $L$, \racketcode{compile-linklet} produces a compiled linklet object $\la$ ready for instantiation. Such an object includes \emph{Import} and \emph{Export} entries that encode the imported and exported variables, respectively. For clarity, we omit the details concerning compilation of basic forms (e.g., \racketcode{begin}, \racketcode{set!}) into runtime \glspl{ast}, focusing instead only on the constructs specific to linklets. Furthermore, the body of a compiled linklet will include additional runtime expressions inserted during compilation to manage dynamic variable manipulations, as explained in detail in subsequent paragraphs.

		\paragraph{}% 5 + 6
			Before \racketcode{compile-linklet} is invoked, several preprocessing passes are performed on the linklet body. These passes produce \emph{Import} and \emph{Export} objects, each containing internal and external identifiers to accommodate potential renaming, as well as freshly (gensym) generated identifiers for runtime use. Additionally, these preprocessing steps gather information about identifiers defined within the linklet body, and those targeted by mutation operations, all to be used during compilation. Given the sets of \emph{Import}s ($\mathit{C_I}$), \emph{Export}s ($\mathit{C_E}$), top-level defined identifiers ($\mathit{X_T}$), and mutated identifiers ($\mathit{X_M}$), \racketcode{compile-linklet} processes each expression within the linklet body one-by-one. It utilizes the data collected in preprocessing to correctly compile variable references and mutation operations into the appropriate runtime forms.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{compile-linklet-transformation-rules-table}

		\paragraph{}% 7
			\tableRef{table:linklet-compilation-rules} lists the transformation rules applied by \racketcode{compile-linklet} to handle linklet variables. Exported and top-level defined identifiers are compiled into linklet variables expected to be created during instantiation. An exported identifier that is targeted by a \racketcode{set!} is compiled into a \racketcode{var-set/check-undef!} operation to persist mutation across linklets. References to imported variables are also compiled as runtime linklet variable references. Additionally, an exported identifier without a definition, or one that is targeted by mutation, is similarly compiled into a runtime linklet variable reference, as it will be provided by the target instance during instantiation.

		\paragraph{}% 8
			Instantiation of a compiled linklet begins by processing its \emph{Import} and \emph{Export} objects. Imported variables are collected from the provided linklet instances, and exported variables are either fetched from the target instance or freshly created, as previously described in the top-level example (\sectionRef{subsec:toplevel-example}). For simplicity, we denote by $\lb$ a compiled linklet object after this initial step, meaning that $\lb$ no longer explicitly includes import and export objects as these have been resolved. With such a prepared $\lb$, instantiation then proceeds to evaluation of its body expressions.

		\paragraph{}% 9
			Recall that instantiation occurs in two distinct modes: \emph{regular instantiation}, resulting in a new linklet instance, and \emph{targeted instantiation}, which uses an existing target instance and returns the value of the last evaluated expression. As part of preparing a compiled linklet for instantiation, \racketcode{compile-linklet} transitions from $\la$ to $\lb$ by plugging in a target instance. In regular instantiation, this target instance is freshly created as an empty instance, whereas in targeted instantiation, it is the pre-existing instance provided as input to the \racketcode{instantiate-linklet}. For simplicity, we unify these two modes in the semantics by always considering an explicit target instance, and denote the instantiation result uniformly as a pair consisting of the last expression's value and the target instance used during evaluation.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{program-source-language}

		\paragraph{}% 10
			Since linklets alone are binding constructs and cannot initiate computation, we introduce a top-level construct named \racketcode{program} to demonstrate their operational semantics in context. A \racketcode{program} comprises a set of linklets to load and a single top-level expression to initiate computation. The grammar for \racketcode{program} is shown in \figref{fig:linklet-program-source-language}, where the \racketcode{let-inst} form names linklet instances, and the \racketcode{seq} form sequences computations. Additionally, the function $\bm{\Phi^V}$ (\emph{instance-variable-value}) retrieves the value of an exported variable from a given instance.

		\inputFigure{linklets}{linklets-reduction-relation}

		\paragraph{}% 11
			\figref{fig:linklets-reduction-relation} presents the reduction relation, $\beta_p$, which defines the evaluation of linklet programs along with the reduction relation $\beta_l$ for the \gls{lkl}. For clarity and simplicity, the evaluation of programs and linklet instantiations are both expressed by the single relation $\beta_p$, thus forming a coherent, small-step evaluation sequence from programs to values. To maintain readability, trivial reduction rules for forms such as \racketcode{seq} and \racketcode{let-inst} are omitted.

		\subsection{Emulating Top-level REPL Example on Formalism}
		\label{subsec:toplevel-example-formal}

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-formal-program}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 12
			As an example, we can represent the top-level \gls{repl} example from the
			previous section as a linklet \emph{program}, and simulate the
			process. \figref{fig:toplevel-example-repl-interactions-formal} shows the description of the example top-level \gls{repl} interaction from \secref{subsec:toplevel-example} (in \figref{fig:toplevel-example-repl-interactions}) as a \emph{program} form. We prepare the linklets representing each \gls{repl} interaction, and instantiate (execute) them using a target instance we introduce using the \racketcode{let-inst} form.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 13
			\figref{table:toplevel-example-step-by-step-formal} shows the initial (multi-step) reduction steps for $\betaprel$ on our program, conforming to the reduction relation defined in \figref{fig:linklets-reduction-relation}. The reduction begins by running \racketcode{compile-linklet} on all the linklets provided to the \emph{program} form. And after the compilation, the linklets are substituted in the body and the evaluation begins. For clarity in the section, the rest of the reduction steps, reducing the program all the way to the value 10 is moved into the \appendixRef{appendix:formal-reduction-steps-toplevel-example}.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\inputFigure{linklets}{toplevel-example-step-by-step-formal-table}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 14
			After the compilation and loading phase, all the linklet objects are
			in $\la$ form and ready to be instantiated. Recall that a linklet
			instantiation has two modes; \textbf{i)} regular instantiation, where
			a new instance is being created and returned, and \textbf{ii)}
			targeted instantiation, where the given target instance is used during
			the instantiation. Since the only difference between the two modes is
			the return value, for simplicity in the model we remove the
			distinction by turning the regular instantiation into a targeted
			instantiation with a fresh empty instance. The result of both the
			instantiation is then a pair of the last expression's value and the
			target instance being used.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 15
			At the start of instantiation, the imported variables are collected
			from the given linklet instances by simply going through each set of
			\emph{Import} objects in the $\la$ and the corresponding linklet
			instance that provides the variables. The collected variable
			references are then put into the environment with the names in the
			corresponding \emph{Import} objects that were generated for the
			variables during the compilation. Recall that a linklet may export a
			variable despite having no corresponding definition for it. This is
			achieved by for each \emph{Export} object in $\la$ grabbing the
			variable from the target instance if it has a mapping for it and
			making it available in the environment. Otherwise a fresh variable is
			created and its mapping is placed into the environment and into the
			target instance as well.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 16
			After processing the import and export variables, the $\la$ object is
			reduced into $\lb$, which triggers the evaluation of the expressions
			in the linklet body. The linklet compilation makes sure that every
			variable reference within the body uses the appropriate variable, and
			at the beginning of the instantiation the preparation of the import
			and export variables explained above provides the actual variables in
			the environment to be modified and used. The reduction then proceeds
			with the evaluation of the body expressions one-by-one. After all the
			expressions are processed, a pair of the last expression's value and
			the reference to the target instance is returned. The reduction of the
			program continues by similarly instantiating the other two linklets
			and finally returning the last value in the
			\verb|seq| form, all of which are listed in \appendixRef{appendix:formal-reduction-steps-toplevel-example}.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 17

	\section*{\thesection\quad Conclusion}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 1
			The ability to provide high-level functionalities to runtime is one of the key ideas in improving portability.


			The ability to provide high-level functionalities as callable functions to the hosting virtual machine is one of the key ideas in improving Racket’s portability. A VM that wants to host Racket not only gets the high-level implementations such as the module system, macro system for free, but also gets highly re-usable functionalities that it can integrate the systems it implements, such as the top-level repl example in Figure 16.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 2
			Interplay between the language and the runtime is cool.


			Moreover, Racket implements and exports abstract functionalities that are tightly coupled with the hosting runtime as well. For instance the expander linklet provides the eval function, which is basically an abstract interpreter for Racket. A VM that hosts Racket can call eval, which interprets Racket code by using the run-time primitives and compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet that are implemented and provided by the VM itself. Therefore, one of the essential nuances of self-hosting Racket with the expander linklet, is that the interaction between the run-time and the expander is a two-way street. The VM implements and uses compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet to import the functions provided by the expander, and the expander provides functions that uses the compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet functions, along with the other run-time primitives as well.
		\end{paragraph-here}

		\begin{paragraph-here}% 3
			Interplay between the language and the runtime is cool. Merge with the previous paragraph.

			For example, the dynamic-require used above (provided by the expander linklet) is a Racket function that dynamically loads a Racket module (if it’s not already loaded) by resolving the module path, finding the source code in the file system, reading and expanding the codes and modifying the namespace registry. The Racket code inside the expander that implements all that, calls run-time primitives such as for file-system support and also calls the compile-linklet and instantiate-linklet for expanding and instantiating all the required modules. eval works in a similar fashion as well. This intertwined nature of the high-level language facilities and the low-level run-time support is central to the Racket’s improved portability.
