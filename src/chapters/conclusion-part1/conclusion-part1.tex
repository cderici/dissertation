\chapter{Conclusion of Part I}

	\section{Contributions}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			This demonstrates with evidence that it is possible to have a
			working and complete self-hosting functional programming language
			on a meta-tracing JIT compiler.
		\end{mainpoint}

		\begin{paragraph-here}
			Pycket works.

	\section{Significance}
		\begin{mainpoint}
			% Why is this cool/exciting/important?
			Paves the way and provides an example for future work on
			different ways of self-hosting languages.

			It's a step towards more intelligent communication between
			the language and the runtime.

			Having another Racket implementation symmetric to RacketCS
			enables further research on language runtimes for functional
			programming languages.

			It's also beneficial for furthering meta-tracing research.
