\chapter{Future Work}

    \begin{chapterpoint}
        There are a few future directions for this research:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Solve all the issues with self-hosting on meta-tracing JIT, and realize
        the full potential of the approach.
            \item Investigate the language-runtime communication and how it can be improved.
            \item Survey the characteristics of different VMs (e.g. RacketCS vs Pycket) 
            across a variety of computations.
            \item Build on the analysis we provide for the tracing performance of
        branch-heavy code, and make tracing JITs cool again.
        \end{itemize}
